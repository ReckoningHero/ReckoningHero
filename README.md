# About Me
Hey there, Welcome to my profile. I have two years of experience[UC-2Z8ZAY98.pdf](https://github.com/ReckoningHero/ReckoningHero/files/6088498/UC-2Z8ZAY98.pdf)
 in the IT field alongside with some GameDev experience as well. Looking back, I never thought that I would be able to get into this industry with the constant change technology has evolved and adapted. Time sure flies when you learn. Previously, I worked in an agile methodology environment that requires a lot of collaborative and high demanding tasks that need detailed attention and proper understanding of the daily tasks given to us as developers, QA, and operations. Learning the DevOps culture benefited me to finally discover my true strengths and determine my weakness as an individual alone to acknowledge and mature as soon as possible from the likes of developing pipelines in Azure, engaging in operational tasks, and maintaining broken codes to have strong stability in the dev, test, and production environment.  
On my downtime, I would like to work on personal projects in my free time in order to fresh out my game development skills in Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Since I am more of a visual/right-sided brain person, it motivates me to work on something that is both creative and technical at the same time which benefits my career path in the gaming industry.
